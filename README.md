# Election Results Are In!
## Overview of Election Audit
The purpose of this election audit was to help Tom and Seth not only get the the voter turnout for each county but also the percentage, total count and the county with the highest turnout. No big deal. :+1:

## Election-Audit Results
Below is a list of the total votes casted, along with a breakdown of each county. I've also included a breakdown of the number of votes and percentage of votes for each candidate.

## Election-Audit Summary
The script that I have created, with some modifications of course, can be used for any elections. For example, we can see how people are voting in entire United States! We can break it down state by state, and reach into each county (like I demonstrated above). That information can be provided to a certain party to determine which states/counties they are succeding in or which ones need more work. That can save time and resources. Think about it and give me a call :sunglasses:
